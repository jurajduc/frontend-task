The app is really basic generated with create-react-app

To run the application run 

`npm install`
`npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

to run tests run `npm test` - there are just basic component tests 

in a real project i would use different approach to css, write better tests and use ESLint to enforce coding standards. For the actual form i would use something like react-hook-form with zod
